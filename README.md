# datewisedatacomparision
This is a GIS project where the user can select the state and district, then choose the date range (from and to). After that, the user can select the layer they want to compare and hit the Analyze button. The data will be displayed date-wise through a chart, and on the map the corresponding points will be highlighted with identifiers.

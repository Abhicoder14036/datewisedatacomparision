# datewisedatacomparision
This is a GIS project that allows users to select a state and district, and then choose a date range (from and to). After that, the user can select the layer they want to compare and hit the Analyze button. The data will be displayed date-wise through a chart, and on the map, the corresponding points will be highlighted with identifiers.
